# personal-website-2

Code for a new personal website. 

Uses the Vue.js framework. Has a sticky navbar on the side, scrollable interface.

Mostly for a new spin on things. Quite different from my previous website.

Intending to pack a lot of things into a single page. Will likely use PHP for the contact form, as it's easy 
enough to implement.

This is obviously a work-in-progress. Sections may change, ideas will develop, etc.

- Implement PHP for contact form, change filetype.
- Make the structure responsive. No navbar for mobile view.
- Bring in three illustrations for the first panel on the page.
- Implement animations for the illustrations, or pop-ups with text for each illustration.
- Make the navbar elements more responsive, give them poppy animations or something of the sort.
- Implement a carousel or slider for the concern/optimism sections.
