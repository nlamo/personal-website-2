# personal-website-2

Code for a new personal website. 

Uses the Vue.js framework. Has a sticky navbar on the side, scrollable interface.

Mostly for a new spin on things. Quite different from my previous website.

Intending to pack a lot of things into a single page. Will likely use PHP for the contact form, as it's easy 
enough to implement.

In its current state, it is very nicely responsive to normal/large screens and laptop screens. I even think it would look good on tablets. It is *not*, however, responsive at all for smartphone screens, so this will come later (although it is arguably always better to start with mobile).

It is unsatisfactory to use for zoom outside of a variance of 20%. Practically speaking this is all one would need, but it is something worth thinking about.

Since the Vue script is referenced, you can just pull it in and use it as is. At least until I PHP-ify it.

  TODO

This is obviously a work-in-progress. Sections may change, ideas will develop, etc.

- Implement PHP for contact form, change filetype.
- Make the structure responsive for mobile. No navbar, make fonts/containers more responsive, shift the grid views, etc.
- Replace unDraw illustrations with personal/abstract illustrations in time.
- Make the navbar elements more responsive, give them poppy animations or something of the sort.
- Implement a carousel or slider for the concern/optimism sections.
