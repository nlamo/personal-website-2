# personal-website-2

Code for new personal website.

Uses the `Vue.js` framework for the front end, and `PHP` for the contact form. Has a sticky navbar on the side, scrollable content interface.

Mostly for a new spin on things - primarily a front-end exercise. Intending to pack a lot of things into a single page.

In its current state, it looks reasonably good for normal/large screens and laptop screens.

It is *not*, however, responsive at all for smartphone screens, so this will come later (although it is arguably always better to start with mobile).
